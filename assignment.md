## 2. Assessed Module Learning Outcomes

Your coursework will be assessed against these outcomes:

1. **Reason about algorithm efficiency** – Select and implement the most appropriate algorithms for a given task.
2. **Evaluate patterns and paradigms** – Use patterns and paradigms appropriate for specific tasks.
3. **Develop secure software** – Apply standards and secure programming principles.
4. **Create software with system interaction** – Use multi-threading, inter-process communication, memory management, and close interaction with the host OS.
5. **Develop software with a variety of user interfaces** – Implement suitable interfaces (CLI / GUI / menu-driven).

## 3. Assignment Task

### Individual Project (Ethical Hacking & Cyber Security)

- **Individual-based**: Each student completes their own project.
- **Topic**: You can choose your own topic that uses **object-oriented programming**, **data structures**, and **algorithms**.
- **Interface**: The project must have a suitable interface:
  - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, or  
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, or  
  - **Menu-driven interface**.
- **Testing**: Appropriate testing of the software (**unit testing**).
- **Version control**: Use **Git** and **GitHub**.
- **Deliverables**:
  - **Recorded video** (~10 minutes), uploaded to YouTube as **unlisted**, with link in the submission portal.
  - **Written project report** (up to 4000 words ±10%).

### Example Project Ideas (from brief)

- Nmap / Port Scanning  
- Packet Sniffing  
- Distributed file sharing software  
- Steganography Tool  
- Constructing rainbow tables  
- Memory space eater Virus / Trojan horse  
- Data Recovery Tool  
- Network / Web enumeration tool  
- Keylogger  
- Securing ATM details using image steganography  
- Secure Message Chat System  
- Fuzzing with genetic programming  
- Online Transaction Fraud Detection (e.g. backlogging on e-commerce)

### Notes from the Brief

1. **Data structures**: Encouraged to use **your own user-defined data structures** where appropriate, not only built-in ones.
2. **Referencing**: Use **APA 7th** style. Contact Centre for Academic Writing (CAW) for support.
3. **Disability support**: Notify registry course support and module leader.
4. **Backups**: Regularly back up work; the University is not responsible for lost/corrupted work on personal devices.
5. **Extensions**: Technical issues preventing submission may result in an agreed extension (e.g. 24 hours); communicated via Module Leader.
6. **Collusion**: Collusion is taken extremely seriously and will be reported.
7. **Proof of ownership**: A marked difference between your usual style/skill and the submitted work may result in an in-person examination to prove the work is your own.
8. **Proof-readers**: If used, keep your original version available.
9. **Self-plagiarism**: Do not submit work already submitted (partially or fully) for this or another qualification, except where resit/rework is explicitly allowed.

## 6. Assessment Marking Criteria (Rubric)

### 6.1 Report and Video (30%)

| Grade band | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **40%+** | Application is fully functional; explanation of the code is clear. No persistence. |
| **50%+** | Application coding follows the specific programming language coding convention. No persistence. |
| **60%+** | Application uses different structures and libraries given by the language. Uses suitable **persistence** (file **or** database). |
| **70%+** | Application uses **third-party libraries** and advanced techniques. Uses suitable persistence (**both** file **and** database). |

### 6.2 Functionality – Use of Algorithms (30%)

| Grade band | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **40%+** | Application uses different functions for different tasks; each function meets the given specifications. |
| **50%+** | Each function follows the convention of the programming language (e.g. docstrings, comments). |
| **60%+** | Use of **your own logic** rather than only in-built functions; **efficient time complexity**. |

## 7. Assignment Support and Academic Integrity

- **Questions**: Contact your module leader or teacher.
- **Language**: Use effective, accurate, and appropriate language.
- **Academic integrity**: Work must be your own; all sources must be acknowledged and referenced. **AI must be excluded** from production of work (or disclosed as per your institution’s policy).
- **Misconduct**: Detection software and routine checks are used; definitions of plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and collusion are in the Student Handbook on Campus 4.0.
- **Disabilities**: Contact the Student Support Office if you need adjustments.
- **Late submission**: See Student Handbook or Student Support Office for extenuating circumstances.
